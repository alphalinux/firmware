This file is a list of all the firmware for the system.

The exclamation point above is the file terminator, so anything below it
will not be seen by the update utility. Anything above the exclamation
point must adhere to the existing format.
The first line will contain the directory and filename as it appears on
the update media, without the extension and in upper case.
The following line will contain the name of the file to which the image
will be copied on the console's file system.
Nothing else is allowed on either line and no lines should be skipped.

For any new firmware images, there will be only two lines added to this file.
