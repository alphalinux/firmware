Installing the UNIX Binary Release from a Tarball
-------------------------------------------------
Create a temporary directory for storing the tarballs, extracting the
Install script and storing any output logs.  For thie binary release
archive perform the following steps:

    uncompress < TARBALL | tar xpf - Install
    ./Install --tape=TARBALL --installdir=INSTALLDIR binaries

Where "TARBALL" is the name of the binary archive and "INSTALLDIR" is
the location you wish to install the binaries.  If you plan to install
in /usr/cygnus, you may omit the --installdir option.


Installing the Source Tarball on a UNIX System
-----------------------------------------------
Change to the directory where you would like to store the source and run:

    uncompress < src.tar.Z | tar xpf -

This will create a "src" subdirectory containing all the sources used to
build this release.
