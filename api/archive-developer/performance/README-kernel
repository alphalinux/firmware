
The kernel tarballs in this directory contain the following files, which
are replacements for alpha-specific performance critical routines (mostly
assembly language) which have been hand-tuned and/or re-written with the
21264 specifically in mind.

The contributors of these performance patches are:
	Rick Gorton	<rick.gorton@alpha-processor.com>
	Mike Werner	<werner@darkwing.uoregon.edu>
	Kazushige Goto	<goto@statabo.rim.or.jp>

What you can expect:
	A significant reduction in the amount of time spent in the kernel.
	For some throughput tests (a kernel build), a patched kernel consumed
	40% less system time than an unpatched kernel.  Your Mileage May Vary.

What the various files in this directory are:
	README-kernel			This file
	kernelperf-2.2.17.tar.gz	Tarball form of the content
	kernelperf-2.2.17-patch		Patch form

	kernelperf-2.4.0-test6.tar.gz	tarball
	kernelperf-2.4.0-test9.tar.gz	tarball
	kernelperf-2.4.0-test9-patch	Patch form (only for test9 and later)


The files in the 2.2.17 and 2.4.0 kernel patch tarballs are from
the <Kernel>/arch/alpha/ subdirectory tree - the relevant source
files (excluding configuration files) are:
	<kernel>/arch/alpha/lib/clear_user.S
	<kernel>/arch/alpha/lib/copy_user.S
	<kernel>/arch/alpha/lib/csum_ipv6_magic.S
