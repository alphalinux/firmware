AlphaPC 164RX Motherboard

Alpha performance in a competitive PC form factor

By offering a pace-setting performance alternative to x86 and 
RISC platforms, Compaq Computer Corporation's AlphaPC(TM) 
164RX motherboard provides an easy, cost-effective solution 
for companies entering high-performance embedded markets.

Alpha motherboards are designed to use standard PC components 
such as synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) DIMMs, PCI option cards, 
power supplies, and enclosures. The AlphaPC 164RX offers PCI 
and ISA slots, onboard PCI IDE, onboard Ethernet, and memory 
support for up to 512 MB of SDRAM in an ATX form factor.

The AlphaPC 164RX is ideal for performance-focused embedded 
applications such as medical imaging, data and voice 
communications, network and Internet servers, RIP engines - 
any application where performance is critical.

The AlphaPC 164RX motherboard integrates Compaq
Computer Corporation's engineering excellence, quality, and 
performance, creating an optimal solution for today's OEMs.
