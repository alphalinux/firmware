AlphaPC 264DP Motherboard

World class performance for embedded applications

By offering unrivaled performance, the AlphaPC 264DP dual-
processor motherboard provides an easy, cost-effective solution 
for companies developing high-performance embedded products.

Alpha motherboards are designed to use standard PC components such 
as synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) DIMMs and PCI option cards. The 
AlphaPC 264DP offers PCI and ISA slots, onboard PCI IDE, a dual-
port Ultra Wide SCSI controller, and 16 SDRAM DIMMs providing 
access to up to 4 gigabytes of memory. The mainboard contains the 
system chipset, main memory, and all I/O logic. Each daughtercard 
contains a 500-MHz Alpha 21264 microprocessor and L2 cache. One or 
two daughtercards may be used for uniprocessor or dual-processor 
configurations.

The AlphaPC 264DP motherboard provides a dramatic performance 
advantage to embedded applications such as CAT, MRI, 
telecommunication switches, and simulators. At two times the 
performance of its nearest competitor, this product provides the 
ultimate in performance at a competitive cost. OEMs who implement 
the AlphaPC 264DP in their products position themselves as 
providers of the industry's most advanced technology solutions.

The AlphaPC 264DP motherboard integrates Compaq Computer 
Corporation's engineering excellence, quality, and performance, 
keeping Alpha products ahead of the competition.

Hardware features
*
AlphaPC 264DP mainboard supports one or two daughtercards. Each 
daughtercard contains:
- One Alpha 21264 microprocessor operating at a speed of 500 MHz
- A 2 MB, 128-bit L2 cache with late-write HSTL synchronous static 
  RAM (SSRAM)
*
The 21272 core logic chipset on the mainboard interfaces to the 
CPUs, main memory, and dual PCI buses
*
SDRAM memory subsystem includes:
- 128 MB to 4 GB memory complement with 72-bit ECC
- Four memory arrays, each consisting of four 200-pin, 72-bit 
  buffered SDRAM DIMMs
- Memory speed support of 83.3 MHz
*
PCI bus support (33 MHz):
- Six (6) 64-bit slots (one shared with ISA slot)
*
Integrated PCI peripheral 
support:
- Integrated Adaptec(TM) AIC-7895 dual-port, Ultra Wide SCSI 
  controller
- PCI-to-ISA bridge using a Cypress(TM) 82C693UB hyperCache(TM) 
  chip providing:
	 PCI IDE for two devices (PIO mode 4)
	 Keyboard/mouse control and time-of-year clock
*
ISA bus support:
- One dedicated ISA expansion slot (shared with the 32-bit PCI 
  slot)
*
Integrated ISA peripheral support:
- SMSC(TM) FDC37C665 combination controller chip provides diskette 
  control (2.88 MB), two serial port UARTs with modem control, and 
  a parallel port
*
Daughtercard has onboard 
5.0-V to 2.0-V voltage regulation for CPU, and 3.3-V to 1.5-V 
voltage regulation for SSRAM:
