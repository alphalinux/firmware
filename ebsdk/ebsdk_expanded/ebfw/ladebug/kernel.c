 * Revision 1.1.1.1  1998/12/29 21:36:14  paradis
 * Initial CVS checkin
 *
 * Revision 1.44  1998/08/26  18:37:36  thulin
 * Add support for CLUBS
 *
 * Revision 1.43  1998/06/26  18:49:48  gries
 * return +4 on arith trap (print message)
 *
 * Revision 1.42  1997/12/15  20:45:51  pbell
 * Updated for dp264.
 *
 * Revision 1.41  1997/08/12  05:39:18  fdh
 * Modified to use the __EMULATE_FLOATING_POINT conditional.
 *
 * Revision 1.40  1997/08/01  19:15:42  pbell
 * Converted all address and register display routines that print quad words to
 * use the new PRINTF_sl_ macro for the size modifier in printf control strings.
 *
 * Revision 1.39  1997/06/10  18:19:22  fdh
 * Modified due to function name change.
 *
 * Revision 1.38  1997/06/02  04:36:17  fdh
 * Moved the initialization of "child_state" and "stopped"
 * into kinitdebugger(0.
 *
 * Revision 1.37  1997/04/24  21:13:24  pbell
 * Cleaned up warnings
 *
 * Revision 1.36  1997/03/12  11:02:19  fdh
 * Made optional pointer override offset to floating point registers.
 *
 * Revision 1.35  1997/02/26  21:46:02  fdh
 * Modified the printReg function to accept an optional argument
 * which points to a user specified register save state array.
 *
 * Modified ktrap to copy the emulated floating point registers
 * to the debugger's save state area before calling the debugger
 * as though a break point was encountered.
 *
 * Revision 1.34  1997/02/25  21:23:40  fdh
 * Added kinitdebugger and use the noDebugger runtime
 * conditional to disable only the features that impact
 * another debugger debugging the current Debug Monitor.
 *
 * Revision 1.33  1997/02/20  16:56:23  fdh
 * Modified to handle trap state saved on the stack rather
 * than in the breakpoint save state area.  This facilitates
 * debugging within the trap handling procedures.
 *
 * Added printReg() and changeReg() for reading or modifying
 * register state during debugging.
 *
 * Added conditions for using IEEE emulation code for performing
 * all floating point operations when the CPU's floating point unit
 * is disabled.
 *
 * Revision 1.32  1996/05/22  21:49:45  fdh
 * Modified tracing.
 * Reset HAE when a breakpoint is encountered.
 *
 * Revision 1.31  1996/01/26  22:32:52  cruz
 * Fixed bug which caused backward branches to fail with step command.
 *
 * Revision 1.30  1996/01/26  15:10:10  cruz
 * Fixed bug introduced with the next command which prevented
 * stepping into subroutines called with BSR.
 *
 * Revision 1.29  1996/01/26  00:02:48  cruz
 * Added the ability to step over bsr, jsr, and jump instructions.
 *

 * Print arguments to ktrap as 64-bit values.
 *
 * Revision 1.27  1995/12/05  18:37:15  cruz
 * Save the instruction at the breakpoint address at the
 * time the breakpoints are installed (at "run" time) instead
 * of when the user specified the breakpoint.  This fixes a
 * problem which occurred when there were previous breakpoints
 * and a new image was loaded in the range of the breakpoints.
 * The instructions from the old code would be written into the
 * new code once the breakpoints were removed.
 *
 * Revision 1.26  1995/11/09  21:46:49  cruz
 * Changed type of DisStartAddress to "ul" instead of long.

 * register array.
 *
 * Revision 1.22  1995/10/23  22:27:56  cruz
 * Included mon.h which was inadvertantly deleted in the last cleanup.
 *
 * Revision 1.21  1995/10/23  20:49:36  cruz
 * Performed some clean up.
 *
 * Revision 1.20  1995/10/22  05:11:10  fdh

 * Other cleanup.
 *
 * Revision 1.19  1995/10/10  14:17:02  fdh
 * Renamed ladbx.h to ladebug.h.
 *
 * Revision 1.18  1995/08/30  23:03:33  fdh
 * Implemented kremoveallbreak().
 * Made restore_breakpoint_instrs() an external routine.
 *
 * Revision 1.17  1995/06/29  14:16:59  cruz
