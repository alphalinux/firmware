    ================================================================
    This Directory contains trivial programs written in C along
    with a Makefile that can be used to build executable files
    that are used to download and run on the EB64 for demonstration
    purposes.  Some of these files are described here.  Others
    are left for investigation by the users.
    ================================================================

    SOURCE FILES
    ------------
    hello.c     A real simple C program used to test your build environment.

    size.c      A simple C program which prints the size of various data
                types in bytes.  This program was used to produce the
                size.sr and the size files which can be executed on the
                EB64.

    yellow.c    A little C program which makes the EB64 play a short tune
                through the EB64 speaker.  The tune is an old American
                folk song called "The Yellow Rose of Texas".  This was
                compiled into yellow.sr and yellow files which can be
                executed on the EB64.

    S-RECORD FILES
    --------------
    hello.sr, size.sr, yellow.sr
                An S-record file that can be downloaded with the EB64 load
                command.  It is linked to address 300000 hex so it should be
                run with the go command to address 300000.

		eg.
		EB64> load
		 Send File now...
		~>Local file name? /abss_user/fdh/eb64dbm/demo/size.sr
		Loaded 1451 records, 36240 bytes low 300000 high 208D8F check D9
		EB64>
		EB64> go 300000

    EXECUTABLE FILES
    ----------------
    hello, size, yellow
                An image that can be downloaded with bootp.  This image is
                also linked to address 300000 hex. Make sure that bootadr
                is set to 300000 with the EB64 bootadr command. These files
		are copied to the directory that is set up for downloading
		with BOOTP.


		eg.
		EB64> bootadr 300000
		EB64> netboot size
		Ethernet Base Address: 360, DMA Mask: 1 = DRQ5
		Init Block Address 100000
		Init Done.
		Ethernet 08-00-2B-36-6F-C7
		Attempting BOOTP...success.
