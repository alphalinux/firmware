Alpha Motherboard Software Developers Kit V4.0

System Requirements

	An Alpha-based system running Digitial UNIX V4.0A or later
	or Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 3

	65Mb of free disk space

	For Digital UNIX: DEC C++ V5.7 or later

	For Windows NT: Microsoft Visual C++ V5.0 or later

Documentation is provided in PDF format.  Viewing the documentation
requires Adobe Acrobat Reader 3 or later.  Acrobat Reader is provided
on the SDK CD for both Digital UNIX and Windows NT.  The Windows NT
version requires Digital FX!32, which is also provided on the CD.
The install procedure detects whether or not these components are
installed on your system and offers to install them if missing.

SDK Contents:

The SDK includes source code for the Serial ROM CPU initialization
code (SROM), Debug Monitor, Failsafe Booter, example PALcode, and
sample programs.  The SDK also includes all tools other than the
native C++ compiler required to build the SDK components.

SDK Quick Start:

The SDK comes with all binaries (tools and firmware) pre-built from
the included sources.

To install the SDK files on your system:

	Windows NT: Run "SETUP.EXE" in the top-level directory of the CD
	Digital UNIX: Mount the CD, change to the top-level directory,
	   and run the "sdksetup" script

	Read the license agreement and answer all the questions.

To rebuild the firmware from sources, do the following at a shell
prompt (UNIX) or a command line window (NT):

	Change to the "ebfw" subdirectory of the SDK tree
	Type "configure".  Answer the questions.  You should only have to
	   do this step once.
	Type "clean" to clean out all the old executables and object files
	Type "build" to build new object files and executables.

To rebuild the SDK tools from sources, do the following at a shell
prompt (UNIX) or a command line window (NT):

	If you have not yet configured the SDK, change to the "ebfw"
	    subdirectory of the SDK tree and issue the "configure" command
	Type "clean" to clean out all the old toolbox executables
	Type "build" to build new toolbox executables

The SDK directory tree is structured as follows:

          |      +---- obj (binaries built by SDK go here)
