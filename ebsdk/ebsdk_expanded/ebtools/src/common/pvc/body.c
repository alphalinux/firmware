 ********************************************************************************
 *	PURPOSE:
 *	        This is the main loop of the PALcode violation checker. In pseudo-code,
 *	        it does the following:
 *	
 *	        initialize tables and variables
 *	        read the raw executable into bytes[]
 *	        convert that information into array of instructions in exe[]
 *	        search the map file for violation exceptions
 *	        while there are entry points remaining	
 *	                put the code into a tree of instructions
 *	                while there are branches remaining on the tree	
 *	                        remove a branch
 *	                        schedule it (using dual-issue rules, latency matrix, scoreboard) 
 *	                        check it for PALcode violations
 *	
 *	INPUT PARAMETERS:
 *	        entry_list: a list of entry points that need to be checked. 
 *		exe_name: the name of the file with the executable in it.
 *	OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
 *		None

 *		created during prior runs through the code.
 *	INPUT PARAMETERS:
 *		len: the length of the executable code.
 *	OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
