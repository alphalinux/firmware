 * Initial CVS checkin
 *
 * Revision 1.4  1996/12/22  12:31:13  fdh
 * Modified to use a different header signature.  The old
 * header signature is also present for backward compatibility
 * with the old header.  The new signature indicates the
 * presence of additional header fields.

 * Revision 1.3  1996/07/23  22:43:01  fdh
 * Conditionalized for _WIN32 because we can't use the
 * linker defined _end symbol.

 * Revision 1.2  1996/06/13  03:14:32  fdh
 * Modified to use the linker defined variable _end instead
