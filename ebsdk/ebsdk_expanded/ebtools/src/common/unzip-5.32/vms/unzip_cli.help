UNZIP

UnZip is used to extract files compressed and packaged by Zip (see HELP ZIP
for information on ZIP).

For a brief help on Zip and Unzip, run each without specifying any
parameters on the command line (or apply the /HELP qualifier).
To get a brief help sceen about the alternate UNIX style command interface,
run each with the -h option applied.

UNZIP will list, test, or extract from a ZIP archive.  ZIP archives are commonly
found on MS-DOS systems; a VMS version of ZIP can also be found here.

Archive member extraction is implied by the absence of the /SCREEN (-c),
/PIPE (-p), /TEST (-t), /LIST (-l, -v) or /COMMENT (-z) qualifiers (options).
All archive members are processed unless a filespec is provided to
specify a subset of the archive members.
<FORMAT>
UNZIP zipfile [file[,...]] [/qualifiers]

<TOPIC>
Parameters

<PARAMETER>
zipfile

<PTEXT>
File specification for the ZIP archive(s) with optional wildcards. UnZip will
perform actions specified for every zipfile matching the specification.
The default file specification is SYS$DISK:[].ZIP.

Note that self-extracting ZIP files are supported; just specify the .EXE
suffix yourself.
<TXETP>

<PARAMETER>
file

<PTEXT>
An optional comma-separated list of archive members to be processed;
if no list is given, all archive members are processed.  Expressions
may be used to match multiple members.  Expressions should be enclosed
in double-quotes to prevent interpretation by DCL.  Multiple filenames
should be separated by blanks.  Each file specification is similar to
a Unix egrep expression and may contain:

<LITERAL>
|*       matches a sequence of 0 or more characters
|?       matches exactly 1 character
|[...]   matches any single character found inside the brackets;
|        ranges are specified by a beginning character,
|        a hyphen, and an ending character.  If a '!' or '^'
|        immediately follows the left bracket, then any character
|        not in the given range is matched.
<LARETIL>
<TXETP>

<QUALIFIERS>
<QUALIFIER>
/ZIPINFO

/ZIPINFO

Displays information about the Zip archive and the files contained therein.
This function used to be provided by a separate ZipInfo program.

The following qualifiers may be specified with /ZIPINFO:

<LITERAL>
|  /SHORT                 Short UNIX "ls -l" format (default)
|  /MEDIUM                Medium UNIX "ls -l" format
|  /LONG                  Long UNIX "ls -l" format
|  /VERBOSE               Verbose, multi-page format
|  /ONE_LINE              Filenames only, one per line
|  /HEADER                Print header lines
|  /TOTALS                Print totals for files
|  /TIMES                 Print file times in sortable decimal format
|  /[NO]CASE_INSENSITIVE  Match filenames case-insensitively
|  /[NO]PAGE              Page screen output through built-in "more"
<LARETIL>
<QUALIFIER>
/BINARY

/BINARY[=KEYWORD]
/NOBINARY (default)

Selects conversion to VMS "standard" binary file format, which is
"fixed length 512 byte records, no record attributes".
The optional keywords recognized are:
<LITERAL>
|  AUTO     Automatically extracts files marked as "binary" (rather
|           than "text") in standard VMS binary file format. (default)
|  ALL      Extracts all files in standard VMS binary file format.
|  NONE     Same as /NOBINARY.
<LARETIL>

Note that a combination of /BINARY[=AUTO] and /TEXT[=AUTO] is allowed.
(see /TEXT qualifier)
<QUALIFIER>
/BRIEF

/BRIEF (default)

When used with /LIST, specifies that a brief listing of the archive's
contents is to be displayed.  A brief listing shows the length, date,
time, and file name for the files in the archive.
<QUALIFIER>
/CASE_INSENSITIVE

/CASE_INSENSITIVE
/NOCASE_INSENSITIVE (default)

Match filenames case-insensitively.  (Good default option under VMS.)
<QUALIFIER>
/COMMENT

/COMMENT
/NOCOMMENT

Display the archive comment.
<QUALIFIER>
/DIRECTORY

/DIRECTORY=directory-spec

Specifies the output directory where all the extracted files are to be
placed.
<QUALIFIER>
/EXCLUDE

/EXCLUDE=(file[,...])

A comma-separated list of files to exclude when extracting files.
If multiple files are specified, the list should be included in
parentheses.

<QUALIFIER>
/FRESHEN

/FRESHEN
/NOFRESHEN

Freshen existing files; replace if newer.  Does not cause any new files to
be created.
<QUALIFIER>
/FULL

/FULL

When used with /LIST, specifies that a full listing of the archive's
contents is to be displayed.  A full listing shows the length,
compression method, compressed size, compression ratio, date,
time, CRC value, and file name for the files in the archive.
<QUALIFIER>
/HELP

/HELP

Displays a one-page brief help screen and exits quietly.
<QUALIFIER>
/JUNK

/JUNK
/NOJUNK (default)

Junk the stored paths (don't recreated the archive's directory
structure.
<QUALIFIER>
/LIST

/LIST

List the contents of the archive.  /BRIEF and /FULL can be used to
specify the amount of information displayed.  The default is /BRIEF.
<QUALIFIER>
/LOWERCASE

/LOWERCASE
/NOLOWERCASE (default)

Convert filenames from all-uppercase operating systems to lowercase.  This
option has no effect under VMS.
<QUALIFIER>
/OVERWRITE

/OVERWRITE
/NOOVERWRITE

The qualifier /OVERWRITE forces overwriting of existing files when extracting.
The negation /NOOVERWRITE results in never overwriting an existing file.
The default action is to prompt for desired action when about to
overwrite an existing file.

For VMS, "overwriting" results in the creation of a new version of the file,
unless version numbers are stored in the archive and /VERSION is specified.
<QUALIFIER>
/PAGE

/PAGE
/NOPAGE

Feed all screen output through the built-in "more" pager.
<QUALIFIER>
/PASSWORD

/PASSWORD=decryption-password

Specifies a decryption password and prevents UnZip from prompting for
a password in case the specified decryption key was wrong. The supplied
string must be enclosed in double-quotes whenever it contains lowercase
or special characters.
<QUALIFIER>
/PIPE

/PIPE

Extract files to SYS$OUTPUT with no informational messages.
<QUALIFIER>
/QUIET

/QUIET[=SUPER]

Perform operations quietly.  The keyword SUPER can be specified to make
operations even more quiet.
<QUALIFIER>
/RESTORE

/RESTORE
/NORESTORE

Restore file owner and protection settings.
<QUALIFIER>
/SCREEN

/SCREEN
/NOSCREEN

Extracts matching files to SYS$OUTPUT (the terminal).
<QUALIFIER>

A similar functionality is available for binary files, see qualifier /BINARY.
<QUALIFIER>
/UPDATE

/UPDATE
/NOUPDATE

Update existing files; create new ones if needed.
<QUALIFIER>

<TOPIC>
Exit_Codes

On VMS, UnZip's UNIX style exit values are mapped into proper
VMS status codes:
<LITERAL>
|   1                               (success)  normal exit,
|   (0x7fff0000 + 16*UnZip_errnum)  -W- warnings
|   (0x7fff0002 + 16*UnZip_errnum)  -E- normal errors
|   (0x7fff0004 + 16*UnZip_errnum)  -F- fatal errors
<LARETIL>

The UnZip error level (or exit code) approximates the exit
codes defined by PKWARE and takes on the following values:
<LITERAL>
|  VMS       UnZip    Type of error
|  severity  errcode
|    -         0      normal; no errors or warnings detected.
|
|    W         1      one or more warning errors were encountered,
|                     but processing completed  successfully  any-
|                     way.   This  includes  zipfiles where one or
|                     more files was skipped  due  to  unsupported
|                     compression  method  or  encryption  with an
|                     unknown password.
|
|    E         2      a generic error in the  zipfile  format  was
|                     detected.   Processing  may  have  completed
|                     successfully anyway;  some  broken  zipfiles
|                     created by other archivers have simple work-
|                     arounds.
|
|    F         3      a severe error in  the  zipfile  format  was
|                     detected.   Processing probably failed imme-
|                     diately.
|
|    F         4      unzip was unable to allocate memory for  one
|                     or  more  buffers during program initializa-
|                     tion.
|
|    F         5      unzip  was  unable  to  allocate  memory  or
|                     unable  to  obtain a tty to read the decryp-
|                     tion password(s).
|
|    F         6      unzip was unable to allocate  memory  during
|                     decompression to disk.
|
|    F         7      unzip  was  unable to allocate memory during
|                     in-memory decompression.
|
|    F         8      [currently not used]
|
|    E         9      the specified zipfiles were not found.
|
|    E         10     invalid options were specified on  the  com-
|                     mand line.
|
|    E         11     no matching files were found.
|
|    F         50     the disk is (or was) full during extraction.
|
|    F         51     the end of the ZIP archive  was  encountered
|                     prematurely.
|
|    E         80     the user aborted unzip prematurely with con-
|                     trol-C (or similar)
|
|    E         81     no files were found due to unsupported  com-
|                     pression  methods or unsupported decryption.
|                     (If even one additional file is successfully
|                     processed, however, the exit status is 1.)
|
|    E         82     no  files  were  found due to bad decryption
|                     password(s).  This is also the  exit  status
|                     if  no files were found due to a combination
|                     of unsupported  compression  and  bad  pass-
|                     words.   As in the previous case, however, a
|                     single successful file  will  result  in  an
|                     exit status of 1 instead.)
<LARETIL>

In addition, there is a compilation option to expand upon this behavior:
An executable compiled with the option RETURN_CODES defined displays
a human-readable explanation of what the error status means.

<TOPIC>
UNIX_Options

The default action of UnZip is to extract all zipfile entries.  The following
options and modifiers can be provided:

<LITERAL>
|  -Z   ZipInfo mode
|  -c   extract files to SYS$OUTPUT (terminal)
|  -f   freshen existing files (replace if newer); create none
|  -h   show brief help screen and exit quietly
|  -l   list archive files (short format)
|  -p   extract files to SYS$OUTPUT; no informational messages
|  -t   test archive files
|  -u   update existing files; create new ones if needed
|  -v   list archive files (verbose format)
|  -z   display only the archive comment
|
|MODIFIERS
|  -a   auto-extract only text files in standard VMS text file format
|  -aa  extract all files as text
|  -b   auto-extract only binary files in VMS fixed 512 bytes records
|  -bb  extract all files as binary VMS fixed 512 byte record files
|  -j   junk paths (don't recreate archive's directory structure)
|  -n   never overwrite existing files; don't prompt
|  -o   OK to overwrite files without prompting
|  -q   perform operations quietly (-qq => even quieter)
|  -C   match filenames case-insensitively
|  -L   convert filenames to lowercase if created on MSDOS, VMS, etc.
|  -P<pwd>  supply decryption password on the command line (insecure!)
|  -M   page output through built-in "more" function
|  -V   retain (VMS) file version numbers
|  -X   restore owner/protection info (may require privileges)
<LARETIL>

Note that uppercase options such as -C, -L, -M, -P, -V, -X and -Z must
be specified in quotes.  For example:

<LITERAL>
|  $ unzip "-VX" -a zipfile
<LARETIL>

<TOPIC>
UNZIP_OPTS_Default

UnZip allows to modify its default behaviour by specifying (UNIX style)
option defaults via the UNZIP_OPTS logical name.
For example, the following will cause UnZip to match filenames without regard
to case, restore owner/protection information and perform all operations at
quiet-level 1 by default:

<LITERAL>
|  $ define UNZIP_OPTS "-qCX"
<LARETIL>

Note that the quotation marks here are required to preserve lowercase options
(opposite of the command-line behavior). To negate a default option on the
command line, add one or more minus  signs before the option letter, in
addition to the leading switch character `-':

<LITERAL>
|  $ unzip --ql zipfile
<LARETIL>

or

<LITERAL>
|  $ unzip -l-q zipfile
<LARETIL>

At present it is not possible to decrement an option below zero--that is,
more than a few minuses have no effect.

UNZIP_OPTS may be defined as a symbol rather than a logical, but if both
are defined, the logical is used.
