Contents of the "tandem" subdirectory for UnZip 5.32 and later:

  Contents      this file
  rename.unix   Unix shell script to rename Tandem sources before compiling
  make          Tandem NSK script to compile UnZip intelligently
  commacs       generic support macros for compiling
  macros        Info-ZIP-specific macros for compiling
  tandem.c      Tandem NSK-specific support routines
  tandem.h      Tandem NSK-specific data declarations

To compile, run the rename.unix script on a Unix system (renames *.c files
to *c and *.h files to *h, and leaves all files necessary for Tandem port
in the Tandem subdirectory).  Then transfer the renamed files to the Tandem
system (if by ftp, use ASCII mode so the line-endings are converted to CR/LF
format properly).  Edit the `make' script and change all references to
$DATA9.DAVESZIP with whatever subvol you use, and change all references to
SUPER.DAVES with whatever user id you use.  Then run it.  Individual object
files will be named *o (that is, unzip.c -> unzipc -> unzipo), and an
intermediate UnZip library (unziplib) and final UnZip binary (unzipl or
unzipw, depending on large or wide model) will be created.

The filecode for unzipl should be 100 [OBJECT]...presumably this is automatic.
