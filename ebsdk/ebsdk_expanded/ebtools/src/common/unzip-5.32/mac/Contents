The resource file and the compiler project files are in BinHex form because
they contain Macintosh resource forks and as such can not be simply
stored a normal file on a non-Macintosh system.  BinHex form is the
traditional way for transferring such files via non-Macintosh systems.
It's also the safest since it uses only printable characters.  The ".hqx"
files must be converted with StuffitExpander or BinHex 4.0 (or equivalent)
on a Macintosh system before using them.
