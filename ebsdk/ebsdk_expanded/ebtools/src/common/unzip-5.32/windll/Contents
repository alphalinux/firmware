  windll.doc     simplistic explaination of how to use DLL
  structs.h      header file, used by both the DLL and by WiZ, that defines
                 several structures passed to the DLL
  example.c      a very simplistic example of how to load the DLL and make
                 a call into it

Note that Borland C++ 5.0 is full of bugs; version 4.5 or 5.01 is recommended
instead.  If you must use Borland C++ 5.0, using the Intel optimizing compiler
is required to avoid crashes (possibly due to a bug in the stat() function in
the normal Borland compiler).  This does have the advantage of giving you a
smaller code size than the 4.52 compiler.  Borland C++ 5.01 has resolved many
of the problems seen with 5.0 and can be used reliably.

The Microsoft C port has not been tested as completely as the Borland port.
I have been singularly unsuccessful in getting this to compile and run under
MSVC 1.52c.
