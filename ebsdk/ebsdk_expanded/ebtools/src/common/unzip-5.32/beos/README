UnZip 5.32 for BeOS

UnZip 5.30 was the first official release of Info-ZIP's UnZip to support
the filesystem in BeOS.

UnZip 5.31 supports the new filesystem present in Advanced Access Release
DR9 of BeOS.

UnZip 5.32 adds several important bug fixes.

*** WARNING ***
The format of the data stored for the BeOS file attributes had to change 
between unzip 5.31b and unzip 5.31c!  This makes the new unzip incompatible
with the old zip's BeOS file attributes.

You can still unpack the _data_ in older zip files (and there are several
floating around, even though the unzip 5.31b for DR9 beta was only available
for a week), but you won't be able to recover the file attributes in those
archives.

The new scheme makes handling BeOS file attributes much more robust, and
allows for possible future expansion without another round of
incompatibilities.

That's life on the edge!
*** WARNING ***

The new filesystem allows for huge files (up to several terabytes!) with
huge amounts of meta-data (up to several terabytes!).  The existing ZIP
format was designed when this much data on a personal computer was
science fiction; as a result, it's quite possible that large amounts of file
attributes (more than maybe 100+K bytes) could be truncated.  Zip and UnZip
try to deal with this in a fairly sensible way, working on the assumption
that the data in the file is more important than the data in the file
attributes.

KNOWN BUGS

Zip and UnZip are unable to save or restore the file attributes associated
with symbolic links.  This is a shortcoming in the C API for accessing file
attributes and will be addressed by a future version of BeOS.

Please report any bugs to Zip-Bugs@lists.wku.edu.
