[Notes accompanying first beta of VM/CMS port; still mostly applicable
 to the UnZip 5.2 release.  Somebody with a VM/CMS system will have to
 update this file.]

Thank you for trying this first port of UNZIP for VM/CMS and MVS!

This is the first beta so there might be some bugs in it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Additional notes from Greg Hartwig (7/96):

The UNZIP MODULE has been packed to preserve CMS line ends
and is shipped as UNZIP.MOD.
To restore it to an executable module on CMS, do the following:
1. Upload it to CMS as a Fixed file with LRECL 1024.
   Example, from a DOS or OS/2 window, type this:
      SEND unzip.mod A:unzip module a (RECFM F LRECL 1024

2. Use COPYFILE to unpack the file.
   Example, in CMS type this:
      COPYFILE UNZIP MODULE A (UNPACK REPLACE OLDDATE

'+' and '-' are valid characters in CMS file names, so the code
to remove them for CMS is only done for MVS now.

I don't have access to an MVS system, so my changes to the
code have only been tested on CMS.  C/370 version 2.2 was used
to compile the code.

                        Using under VM/CMS:
                    ---------------------------

1. To use the Info-ZIP's UNZIP under VM/CMS you need:

   - C/370 ver 2.1 compiler or another compatible compiler supporting
     long names for function/variable names.

   - that the disk where the compiler is on is accessed

   - at least the following nucleus extensions (display of NUCXMAP):

     NAME      ENTRY    USERWORD ORIGIN   BYTES   AMODE (Attributes)
     EDCX24    0038B000 00000000 0038B000 00002FD8  ANY  SYSTEM
     EDCXV     001D1000 00000000 001D1000 000824C8   31  SYSTEM

2. To compile the program under VM/CMS do :

   - unzip all the files from unz512vm.zip file. They are stored as
     ASCII format so you have to unzip them first on PC or other
     system that already have UNZIP, and then upload them to the
     mainframe with ASCII to EBCDIC conversion.

   - execute UNZVMC to compile and link all the sources.

   - if everything is ok you will get an UNZIP MODULE

3. Using UNZIP

   - Just read the UNZIP.DOC

   - A few exceptions concerning VM/CMS

     3.1. use always filename.filetype.mdisk format to specify
          vm/cms files

     3.2. If the ZIP file has been zipped on an ASCII based system
          it will be automatically translated to EBCDIC
          ( I hope I got all those translation tables OK :-)

     3.3. The date and the time of the output files is set to the
          current system date/time - not according the date/time in
          the zip file.

     3.4. You can even unzip using VM/CMS PIPELINES
          so unzip can be used as pipeline filter:

          'pipe cms unzip -p test.zip george.test | count lines | cons'
          ( we do also a lot of pipethinking here ;-)

     3.5. If you got also the ZIP program (see ZIP201VM.ZIP) you can
          do zipping and unzipping without translating to ASCII
          the ZIP also preserves the file information (LRECL,BLKSIZE..)
          So when you UNZIP a file zipped with ZIP under VM/MVS it
          restores the file info.

          There currently some problems with file with RECFM=V*
          I don't save the length of each record yet :-)

     3.6. No wildcards are supported in the input zip name you have
          to give the real name (.zip is not necessary)

          So you CAN'T use things like: unzip -t *.zip

     3.7. But you CAN use wildcards as filename selection like:
          unzip -t myzip *.c  - OK or even
          unzip -t myzip *.c -x z*.c  - to exclude all files matching
                                        z*.c

     3.8. A filename translations is being done in some cases:
         - when there is no filetype (extension) the name becomes
           firstname.NONAME

     3.9. When you unzip a file all of your currently accessed disks
          are checked for the existence of this file if it exist
          somewhere you get a reply if you want to overwright it ot no

     3.10. If you have CMS PIPELINES installed you can use the MC EXEC
           as a MAKE utility to conditional compile all the sources
           using as input UNZIP MAKEFILE.

     3.11. NO SFS is supported if you are using VM/ESA - everything is
           extracted to the current directory.

     3.12. You can specify destination minidisk for unzip using the -d
           option. Example : UNZIP myzip *.c -d b
           This will unzip all .c files on your B disk.

      3.9. All '+' or '-' signs are skipped from the filenames

Please report all bugs and problems to :
     Zip-Bugs@lists.wku.edu

That's all for now.

Have fun!
