 * Source files that are common between the ebfw source

 * conflicts in their requirements for libraries, definitions,
 * etc.  The basic difference is that ebtools are built
 * to run natively with an operating system where the ebfw
 * tree is built to run in a freestanding environment on,
 * typically, an evaluation board target.  Therefore, this
 * file is used to provide the proper environment for building
 * those common files in the ebtools source tree.
